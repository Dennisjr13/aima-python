- make simulation more computationally/time efficient
    - it's already memory-efficient, maybe we can sacrifice
      some of that so that the simulation doesn't lag as much
    - separate components into surfaces, which are later blitted together
- encapsulate updating the SLAM map
    - move all draw methods of the SLAM map into the Map Class definition
        (and out of the Simulation class definition)
- keep the code DRY (reparameterize the screen_size components)
